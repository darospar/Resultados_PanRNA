I of cytochrome c oxidase (Complex IV); Complex IV is the terminal member of the mitochondrial inner membrane electron transport chain; one of three mitochondrially-encoded subunits","Anti-repressor that increases 2 micron plasmid copy number; increases 2 micron plasmid copy number by relieving repression of the FLP1 site-specific recombinase caused by the Rep1-Rep2p trascription regulator; also itself repressed by the Rep1p-Rep2p complex","Master regulator that regulates transcript levels of the FLP1 gene; acts in concert with Rep1p to regulate transcript levels of the FLP1 gene that promotes plasmid copy amplification and 2-micron plasmid-inheritance; also autoregulates levels of its own transcript; required for Rep1p stability; both Rep1p and Rep2p are sumoylated which is important for function","18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA); component of the small (40S) ribosomal subunit; involved in codon recognition by tRNAs or the release factor eRF1 (Sup45p); encoded in the rDNA repeat (RDN1) as part of the 35S primary transcript","25S ribosomal RNA (25S rRNA); component of the large (60S) ribosomal subunit; encoded in the rDNA repeat (RDN1) as part of the 35S primary transcript; formed by endonucleolytic cleavage at the C2 site of internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2)","Cystathionine gamma-lyase; catalyzes one of the two reactions involved in the transsulfuration pathway that yields cysteine from homocysteine with the intermediary formation of cystathionine; protein abundance increases in response to DNA replication stress","Protein Involved in spore wall assembly; localizes to lipid droplets found on or outside of the prospore membrane; shares similarity with Lds2p and Rrt8p, and a strain mutant for all 3 genes exhibits reduced dityrosine fluorescence relative to the single mutants","Subunit of both RNase MRP and nuclear RNase P; RNase MRP cleaves pre-rRNA, while nuclear RNase P cleaves tRNA precursors to generate mature 5' ends and facilitates turnover of nuclear RNAs","H subunit of the mitochondrial glycine decarboxylase complex; glycine decarboxylase is required for the catabolism of glycine to 5,10-methylene-THF; also required for all protein lipoylation; expression is regulated by levels of 5,10-methylene-THF","Cytoplasmic protein involved in mitochondrial function or organization; null mutant displays reduced frequency of mitochondrial genome loss; potential Hsp82p interactor","Acetyl-coA synthetase isoform; along with Acs2p, acetyl-coA synthetase isoform is the nuclear source of acetyl-coA for histone acetylation; expressed during growth on nonfermentable carbon sources and under aerobic conditions","Pre-ribosomal factor involved in 60S ribosomal protein subunit export; associates with the pre-60S particle; shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm","NAD-dependent (R,R)-butanediol dehydrogenase; catalyzes oxidation of (R,R)-2,3-butanediol to (3R)-acetoin, oxidation of meso-butanediol to (3S)-acetoin,
